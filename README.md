want to creat a powerpoint presentation but dont want the dedious task of looking for information
or asking ai to write it and looking for pictures?
well with this repo it does all that for you
just tell the program what is your subject, the number of slides, number of pictures per slide and the
language you want it in and it will creat the powerpoint saved on a folder in your desktop called presentation so you
can go and edit it
